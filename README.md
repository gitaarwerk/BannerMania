# Banner Mania
Who didn't grow up with a computer that just did, or didn't have more than one color screens. You know, monochrome screens. Of course, the satisfying dot-matrix printers were great. 

So many people I speak to, (of my age at least), can remember this. they also remember: "Banner Mania". It was great fun! 
You can still download it for MS-DOS, legally. I thought..why not bring it to the web?

_This project is not a direct port, but a try to recreate Banner Mania on the web._


## Credits ([excerpt by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_Mania))
```
Banner Mania was a banner making program for IBM PC compatible computers, enabling the user to create banners, posters, signs and logos. It was released by Broderbund in 1989 and was developed for Pixellite Group by Presage Software Development and written by Christopher Schardt and Dane Bigham.

Banner Mania allowed the user to create and print multi-page banners, with 19 different fonts and effects in 16 colors.

## Some challenges to come
Some interesting ideas come up. As some of us had colored screens, some monochrome, or somewhat in-between (CGA anyone?), being able to render colors in different way is fun to bring back the original experience. It also inspires me to create a plugin that transform colors to a screen-mode. Not sure if it's already there, but let's go with this. Also... how to get all those text effects? Not sure what's going to happen,... but sure is going to be a fun ride.
